            <h1 style="text-align: center;">How G20 works</h1>
            <p>For one year, the G20 Presidency sets the agenda and hosts the Summit. The Finance Track and the Sherpa Track are two concurrent tracks that make up the G20. Sherpas run the Sherpa Track after the Finance Track, which is led by finance ministers and central bank governors.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The G20 process is coordinated from the Sherpa side by the Sherpas of the participating nations, who serve as the Leaders' personal envoys. The Finance Track is overseen by the central bank governors and finance ministers of the participating nations. There are working groups with a particular focus on each of the two tracks, in which participants come from the member countries' relevant ministries as well as from invited/guest nations and different international organizations.
        The Ministry of Finance largely oversees the Finance Track. Throughout each Presidency's term, these working groups convene frequently. The G20's substantive work is coordinated and agenda items are discussed by the Sherpas throughout the course of the year.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Additionally, there are Engagement Groups that bring together individuals from the G20 countries' civil society organizations, legislatures, think tanks, youth, labor, businesses, and researchers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Group does not have a permanent secretariat. The Presidency is supported by the Troika â€“ previous, current and incoming Presidency. During India's Presidency, the troika will comprise Indonesia, India and Brazil, respectively.</p>
